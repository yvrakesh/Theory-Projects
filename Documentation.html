                Why is Water Quality Analysis required?
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;Water quality analysis is required mainly for monitoring purposes. Nowadays water is sold by some of the industries mainly say drinking water which is being consumed by a lot of people so it is mandatory to check whether the company is maintaining the standard water quality parameters.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Some importance of such assessment includes:
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> To check whether the water quality is hand-in-hand with the standards, and hence, suitable or not for the designated use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To monitor the efficiency of a system, working for water quality maintenance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To check whether the existing machine works properly or if not what are the changes to be made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To monitor whether water quality is hand-in-hand with rules and regulations.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;Hence it is extremely necessary for the sectors of public health(especially drinking water), industrial use, agriculture use, etc. If there are any farms nearer to industries then the water quality analysis must be done there because there are higher chances of water pollution because of the industrial wastes. If the crops are polluted it finally leads to damage to public health. Hence it is extremely necessary.<br id = "he6">

                Total Suspended Solids:
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;TSS is identified as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act. TSS was earlier known as non-filterable residue (NFR). TSS is the dry-weight of particles that are trapped by a filter having a specified pore size.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;To find TSS of a water snbsp;le, the measured volume of water should be passed through a pre-weighed filter having a specified pore size, then taking the weight of filter again after drying to evaporate the water in the filter paper. Filters composed of glass fibers are typically used for measuring TSS. The dry weight measure of the particles present in the water snbsp;le is the gain in weight & it is expressed in units derived or calculated from the volume of filtered water. Turbidity also tends to measure almost the same quality of water property as TSS, TSS is more useful as it gives an actual weight of the undissolved material in the snbsp;le provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;Total Suspended Solids consist of a huge variety of materials, for exnbsp;le, decaying plant, silt and animal matter, sewage & industrial wastes. Water having a high concentration of suspended solids might cause problems for aquatic life & stream health. High Total Suspended Solids in a water body might indicate a higher amount of metals, pesticides, and bacteria present in the water. Higher amount of TSS can also cause problems for industrial use, as the solids might clog or scour pipes and machinery.<br id = "he7">

                Total Dissolved Solids:
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;A measure of the combined content of all inorganic and organic substances contained in a liquid in molecular, ionized or micro-granular suspended form is called Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The solids should be small enough to survive filtration through a filter that has two-micrometer (nominal size or smaller) pores. We generally discuss TDS for freshwater systems only, as salinity consists of some of the ions contributing to the definition of TDS. The Study of water quality for streams, rivers, and lakes is the most important application of TDS, although TDS is not a primary pollutant, TDS is used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of drinking water and as an indicator of the presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants. Agricultural and residential runoff are primary sources for TDS in receiving waters, and so are leaching of soil contamination and point source water pollution discharge from industrial plants. Calcium, phosphates, nitrates, sodium, potassium, sulfates and chloride comprise few of the important chemical constituents. The chemicals might be cations, anions, molecules or agglomerations on the order of one thousand or fewer molecules, so long as a soluble micro-granule is formed. Pesticides arising from surface runoff are more exotic and harmful elements of TDS. Certain naturally occurring total dissolved solids arise from the weathering and dissolution of rocks and soils.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;Gravimetry and conductivity are the two important methods of measuring total dissolved solids. Gravimetric methods are the more accurate methods and they involve evaporating the liquid solvent and taking the mass of residues left. This is the best method generally, but it is time-consuming. If inorganic salts are there as the great majority of TDS, gravimetric methods are more appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;The concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water is directly related to the electrical conductivity of water. Ions in the dissolved solids in water generate the ability for that water to conduct electrical current, which is measured by a TDS meter or conventional conductivity meter. Conductivity generally provides an approximate value for the TDS concentration, usually to within ten-percent accuracy. Hard water has high TDS levels, which might be the reason for scale buildup in filters, pipes, and valves, reducing performance and adding to the cost of system maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&ensp;In aquariums, spas, swimming pools, and reverse osmosis water treatment systems, we can see these effects. Total dissolved solids are tested frequently in all these applications,and filtration membranes are also checked just to prevent adverse effects. TDS is generally monitored in order to create a water quality environment which is favorable for organismProductivity in the case of hydroponics and aquaculture. For freshwater oysters, trout, and other high-value seafood, the highest productivity, and economic returns are achieved by mimicking the pH and TDS levels of the native environment of each & every species. Total dissolved solids is considered one of the best indices of nutrient availability for the aquatic plants being grown for hydroponic uses.

            Significance of Total Dissolved Solids in Water:
        </h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;The total dissolved solids concentration of good & palatable drinking water should not be more than 500 mg/L according to general belief. However, higher concentrations might be consumed without harmful physiological effects and might be even more beneficial indeed. This limit was set on the basis of taste thresholds. Wildlife and livestock might get injured by drinking water that contains total dissolved solids exceeding this limit. Continuous use of such water might cause weakness, scouring, reduced production, bone degeneration, and death. However, temporarily, animals can drink high saline waters, but that will be harmful if used continuously.

            &emsp;&ensp;The measure of the ability of an electrolyte solution to conduct electricity is called its conductivity. Conductivity is also referred to as specific conductance. The SI unit of conductivity is siemens per meter (S/m). In many industrial and environmental applications, conductivity measurements are used as an inexpensive, reliable and fast way of getting the measure of the ionic content in a solution. For exnbsp;le, A typical way to monitor and continuously trend the performance of water purification systems is the measurement of product conductivity. Conductivity is directly linked to the total dissolved solids (T.D.S.) in various cases. Conductivity is found out by measuring the AC resistance of the solution between two electrodes. Dilute solutions follow Kohlrausch's Laws of concentration dependence and the additivity of ionic contributions. A theoretical explanation of Kohlrausch's law by extending the Debye–Hückel theory was given by Lars Onsager.

            &emsp;&ensp;Siemens per meter id the SI unit of conductivity and it generally refers to 25 °C. Often, the traditional unit of μS/cm is used in industries. 10 6 μS/cm = 10 3 mS/cm = 1 S/cm. Sometimes, a unit of "EC" (electrical conductivity) is seen on the scales of instruments: 1 EC = 1 mS/cm. Occasionally, we also encounter is a so-called mho (reciprocal of ohm): 1 mho/m = 1 S/m. Historically, mhos antedate Siemens by many decades; good vacuum-tube testers, for instance, gave transconductance readings in micromhos. The standard cell, which is most commonly used as a width of 10 mm, and thus for very pure water in equilibrium with air would have a resistance of about 10 6 ohms, known as a megohm, also sometimes known as "megaohm". Ultra-pure water can get to 18 megohms or more. Thus megohm-cm was used earlier, sometimes spelled as "megohm". Occasionally, a conductivity is given just in "microSiemens" (removing the distance term in the unit). While this can be seen as an error, it can generally be assumed to be equal to the traditional μS/cm. The typical conversion of conductivity to the total dissolved solids is done assuming that the solid is sodium chloride: 1μS/cm is taken to be an equivalent of about 0.6 mg of NaCl per kg of water. Molar conductivity’s SI unit is S m 2 mol −1. Older publications have the unit Ω −1 cm 2 mol −1. The presence of inorganic dissolved solids such as chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate anions (ions that carry a negative charge) or sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and aluminum cations (ions that carry a positive charge) affect the value of conductivity in water. Various organic compounds like phenol, oil, sugar, and alcohol do not conduct electrical current well and therefore possess a low conductivity in water.Temperature affects the conductivity as well: the warmer the water, the higher the conductivity. For this reason, conductivity is often reported as conductivity at 298.15 K.

            &emsp;&ensp;The conductivity of water in streams and rivers is affected basically by the geology of the area through which the water is flowing. Streams running through areas with granite bedrock generally have lower conductivity because granite is composed of more inert materials that do not ionize (dissolve into ionic components) when washed into the water. On the other hand, streams that run through areas with clay soils tend to have higher conductivity because of the presence of materials that ionize when washed into the water. Groundwater inflows can have the same effects depending on the bedrock they flow through. Discharges to streams have the potential to change the conductivity depending on their make-up.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;A failing sewage system would raise the conductivity because of the presence of chloride, phosphate, and nitrate; an oil spill tends to lower the conductivity. High-quality deionized water has a conductivity of about 5.5 μS/m, typical drinking water in the range of 5-50 mS/m, while seawater about 5 S/m. Distilled water has a conductivity in the range of 0.5 to 3 μmhos/cm. Studies of inland freshwaters indicate that streams supporting well-mixed fisheries have a range between 150 and 500 μhos/cm. Conductivity outside this range could indicate that the water is not suitable for certain species of fish or macroinvertebrates. Industrial waters can range as high as 10,000 μmhos/cm.

            Turbidity:
        </h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;The haziness or cloudiness of a fluid due to various individual particles ( TSS or TDS) that can be seen with naked eyes (like smoke in air) is known as turbidity. The determination of the value of turbidity might be termed as one of the most important tests of water quality.Fluids may have suspended solid matter consisting of particles of various different sizes. While some will be big enough to settle down quickly at the bottom of the container if a liquid snbsp;le is left to stand, the smaller ones might settle very slowly or might not settle at all if the snbsp;le is agitated consistently or if the colloidal particles are present. These solid particles, which are smaller in size are the reason for any liquid to look like turbid.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;Turbidity (or haze) is considered in the case of transparent solids such as glass as well. In plastic production, the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction is known as haze. Turbidity can also be termed as the measure of a liquid’s relative clarity. Turbidity is an optical characteristic of water and is also an expression of the amount of light scattered by material in the water when a light shines through the water snbsp;le. The higher the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity. Material causing water to be turbid include silt, clay, finely divided inorganic and organic matter, soluble colored organic compounds, algae, plankton, and various other microscopic organisms. Turbidity makes the water cloudy or opaque. The water collected in the bottle is used to find out the turbidity, which is measured by shining a light through the water and is measured in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). During periods of low flow (baseflow), many rivers are a clear green color, and turbidites are low, usually less than 10 NTU.

            &emsp;&ensp;High concentrations of particulate matter affect light penetration and productivity, recreational values, and habitat quality, and cause lakes to fill in faster. In streams, increased sedimentation and siltation can take place, which might result in harming the habitat areas for fish and other aquatic life. Particles also provide attachment places for some other pollutants, especially bacteria and metals. That’s why turbidity readings are used as an indicator of potential pollution in a water body.

        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;Excessive turbidity, or cloudiness, in drinking water is aesthetically unappealing, and may also represent a health concern. Turbidity can provide shelter and food for pathogens. Regrowth of pathogens in the distribution system is promoted if the turbidity is not removed, leading to waterborne disease outbreaks, which have caused significant cases of gastroenteritis throughout the world. Although turbidity is not a direct indicator of health risk, numerous studies show a strong relationship between removal of turbidity and the removal of protozoa. The particles of turbidity provide "shelter" for microbes by reducing their exposure to attack by disinfectants. Microbial attachment to particulate material has been considered to aid in microbe survival. Fortunately, traditional water treatment processes have the ability to effectively remove turbidity when operated properly.

            pH value:

        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;pH is basically a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Solutions having pH less equal to 7. Primary pH standard values are found out by using a concentration cell with transference, simply by measuring the potential difference between a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode & hydrogen electrode. Measurement of pH for aqueous solutions can be done with a pH meter or a glass electrode. We can also find the value of pH by using indicators. pH measurements have significant importance in the field of biology, environmental science, chemistry, medicine, oceanography, food science, agriculture, nutrition, civil engineering, chemical engineering, forestry, water treatment & water purification and many other applications. Mathematically, it can be said that pH is the negative logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion.

            Importance of pH
        </h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&ensp;The solubility (the amount that can be dissolved in the water) and biological availability (an amount that can be utilized by aquatic life) of chemical constituents such as nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon) and heavy metals (lead, copper, cadmium, etc.) can be determined by pH of water. For exnbsp;le, in addition to affecting how much and what form of phosphorus is most abundant in the water, pH also determines whether aquatic life can use it. Metals are generally more toxic at lower pH as they are more soluble. Extremely low and high pHs can be significant for the use of water. High pH causes a bitter taste, water pipes and water-using appliances become encrusted with deposits, and it also depresses the effectiveness of the disinfection of chlorine, thereby generating the need for additional chlorine when pH is a bit high. Low-pH water might corrode or dissolve metals and other substances. Pollution has the potential to change the pH of water, which might harm animals and plants living in the water.

Sulfates find their way into water through smelters and mines and also from kraft pulp and paper mills, tanneries & textile mills. Sulfates of potassium, magnesium, and sodium are highly soluble in water, while barium and calcium sulfates and various other heavy metal sulfates are little less soluble. Sulfur dioxide & Sulphur trioxide also contribute to the sulfate content of water to some extent.

            &emsp;&ensp;Cathartic effects are commonly reported to be experienced by people consuming drinking-water containing sulfate with higher concentrations. Although it is also reported that humans can adapt to higher concentrations with time. Dehydration is another common side-effect following the ingestion of large amounts of sodium or magnesium sulfate exposed to tap water containing sulfate with a median concentration of 264 mg/liter and a range of up to 2787 mg/liter, compared with the risks for those not using tap water or using low-sulfate tap water, there was no significant association between sulfate ingestion and the incidence of diarrhea for the range of concentrations studied. Reviews of the literature and a study to experimentally determine a sulfate dose that would induce effects in adults concluded that it was not possible to set a health-based standard for sulfate in drinking-water and confirmed the conclusions of other workers. The presence of sulfate in drinking-water can also result in a noticeable mg/liter as the sodium salt. Sulfate may also contribute to the corrosion of distribution systems.

            &emsp;&ensp;In light of the above considerations, no health-based guideline value for sulfate in drinking water is proposed. However, there is an increasing likelihood of complaints arising from a noticeable taste as concentrations in water increase above 500 mg/liter.

It is found that chloride concentration in groundwater and drinking-water is  consistently increasing, but there have been a few exceptions. Chloride  levels in unpolluted waters are generally below 10 mg/liter and sometimes  even below 1 mg/liter.

            &emsp;&ensp;Chloride toxicity has not been observed in humans except in the exceptional case of impaired sodium chloride metabolism. Healthy human beings can tolerate the intake of large quantities of chloride if there is a sufficient intake of freshwater. Chloride increases the electrical conductivity of water and also its corrosivity. Chloride concentrations in excess of about 250 mg/liter can give rise to detectable taste in water, but the threshold depends upon the associated cations. Consumers can, however, become accustomed to concentrations in excess of 250 mg/liter. No health-based guideline value is proposed for chloride in drinking-water.

The ions of iron form sulfates, nitrates, carbonates & hydroxides & elemental iron are rarely found in nature. The most common form of iron found in nature is that of oxides. Bacterial growth is generally promoted by iron which is pretty undesirable. Aeration of iron-containing layers in the soil can affect the quality of both groundwater & surface water , if the groundwater table is lowered or nitrate leaching takes place. The dissolution of iron might take place as a result of oxidation & decrease in pH.The concentration of iron is about 0.7 mg/l in rivers. Concentration is in the range of 0.5-10 mg/l in anaerobic groundwater where iron is generally in the form of Fe(II). The concentration of iron in drinking water should be less than 0.3 mg/l.

Manganese occurs naturally in many surface water and groundwater sources and in soils that may erode into these waters. However, human activities are also responsible for much of the manganese contamination in water in some areas. Ambient manganese concentrations in seawater have been reported to range from 0.4 to 10 μg/l, with an average of about 2 μg/l. Levels in freshwater typically range from 1 to 200 μg/l. Manganese has a median level of 16 μg/l in surface waters. Higher levels in aerobic waters are usually associated with industrial pollution.
